# Video streaming in Java

**Curious how to get started with video streaming in Java?**

This repository offers a clear and concise example of building a **Spring Boot** application capable of serving video content,
allowing users seeking on this.
You will find a simple API that provides video streams, along with a static HTML page, with a **Vanilla JavaScript code**, to easily fetch and display them.

**Please be aware:** While this project illustrates the core concepts of video streaming, It's designed as a learning resource.
It does not implement caching and other techniques related to data optimization, and as such, should not be deployed in a
production environment.

No!! Just putting this project running in a simple infrastructure it is not possible to handle thousands of simultaneous
access.
